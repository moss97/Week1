Create a directory (folder) for your week 1 assignment.  

Create a repository on the GitHub website. 

Push your directory of files to GitHub as instructed in the video. 

After your first push, please ensure that you make some changes to your directory (folder), such as adding a new file or changing your code. Push those changes to your repository a second time (as shown in the video).
